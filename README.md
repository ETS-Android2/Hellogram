This project was meant to be a project of advanced programming professor Ali Hamze shiraz university. It is an integrated app with 2 interfaces first android and second java desktop app.
The program was written in java and the desktop interface was prepared using JOptionPane library in javax.swing.
In this project, we have designed and developed an Instagram application which you can see in the project docs in this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CTGvszgJnpXxPfBzoC9FqgLjuEraYIa2K5vZY_pKmBs/edit).

You can see the UML class diagram for this app in the folder UML in main repository. Our application fully supports page privacy (private/public) and users can log-in or sign-up in the app also this process of signing in and signing up supports 2FA using email. After we sign in to the program we see 4 main pages of the Instagram which are Home Page and Search Page and User Page (Profile Page) and Massage Page. 
The Massage Page supports both private chats and group chats. The group chats have admins and members which admins can add or remove members from the group or promote them from member to admin. Also, the group has a request page which everyone can search the group's ID and confirm the request and wait for admins to accept or reject their request. After that, they will be a member of the group. 
On the home page, Users will see the posts that have been published by followed Users which for following a user you must go to the search page. 
In the search page you have to search name or the username of the user you'd like to see its profile. You may not see the search users post because they have set their privacy to private not public. In this case you must first request to follow them and if they accept your follow request now you can also see their posts.
Each post has a post page which you can see the post's caption and the post image or video.
Also in each post page you will able to see see 2 sections that are like and comment section. In the comment section you can comment on the post and the comment itself supports like and reply tasks which other users can like your comment or reply on it.
Also in the like section you can like the post or dislike it and also you can the see list of all likers.
